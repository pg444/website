the infrastructure of the modern world is cast from molten grief
and melted/bodies of metal/bodies that
recast themselves into the lungs of the
living, trying to remember how to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
the dead cannot be buried they are smelted
and melted-into gold-into oil-into grease- in
alchemical processes are chemical processes
and process remains until nothing remains until
nothing is buried it is lithically altered
and lethargically shifted but you cannot
      </p>
      <p>
force the memory out of their form
so they are prismatic, tabular,
bladed, botryoidal,
and they reticulate - they cannot
rearticulate with tongue -
relying on seismic semiotics
until they sublime into
      </p>
      <p>
foam that floats and clumps
and the lumps remind you of protrusions
in calcite structures
in skeletons sutured
so they might hold together the
infernal infrastructures
      </p>
      <p>
pumping marrow into engines,
grease loosening their stitches
and sludge seeping out of fossils.
there’s no/body left to bury.
no death is unalive.
bipedal detritivores starving
for matter it doesn’t matter that is how
fuel is made is making itself.
