    the current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: 
        educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into 
        one of learning, sharing, and caring. — ivan illich, deschooling society

    exalted time is also the temporality of schools of higher education. in ancient Greek, ‘school’ is scholé, that is, leisure. 
    schools of higher education would thus be schools of higher leisure. today, they are no longer places of high leisure. 
    they have become places of production, factories of human capital. 
    they pursue professional training rather than formative education [bildung]. 
    formative education is not a means to an end but an end in itself. 
    through formative education spirit relates to itself instead of subordinating itself to an external purpose.

        to the extent that trees deviate from their natural form, pruning and insect extermination become necessary; 
        to the extent that human society separates itself from a life close to nature, schooling becomes necessary. 
        in nature, formal schooling has no function. - masanobu fukuoka
